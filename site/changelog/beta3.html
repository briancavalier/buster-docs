<h1>Buster.JS Beta 3</h1>

<h2>Breaking changes</h2>

<p>This is a list of breaking changes in this release. Since we haven't reached 1.0 stable yet, we're changing APIs without making them backwards compatible.</p>

<h3>Some expectations changed names</h3>

<p>We're renaming some of our expectations, the intent is basically to match the expectations in Jasmine since that's what people are used to, and since they have good well thought out names.</p>

<p>TODO: Add list of changes. Issue 91</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed some bugs in server proxying for browser tests (<a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster/issues/57">#57</a>)</li>
  <li>Added a new property to the config file, <code>testHelpers</code>. It's identical to <code>tests</code>, except that they will not be excluded when running specific test files with <tt>buster test -t tests/my-test.js</tt>. <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster/issues/95">#95</a></li>
  <li>The body of the testbed HTML in browser tests will now reset between each test run. It will not be cleared out entirely, it will be set to what it was initially. Note: this is not yet fixed in buster-static. (<a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster/issues/74">#74</a>)</li>
  <li>Bug: Browser tests now fail when a test times out when there are successful tests in the same test run. (<a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster/issues/77">#77</a>)</li>
  <li>Bug: Browser tests now fail when there's no assertions in a test. (<a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster/issues/69">#69</a>)</li>
  <li>Bug: <code>buster.log(function(){});</code> would log undefined, as it called the function because of internals in buster-evented-logger. It no longer calls the function, and logs what you'd expect it to log. (<a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster/issues/94">#94</a>)</li>
  <li>Bug: Asserts are now counted properly in the JsTestDriver extension. (<a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster/issues/49">#49</a>, <a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster/issues/31">#31</a>)</li>
  <li>At some point in time, an unknown change fixed a small problem with <code>assert.calledOnce</code>. Nobody knows what, where and why. (<a href="https://github.com/busterjs/buster/issues/70">#70</a>)</li>
</ul>
