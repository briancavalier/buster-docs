<h1>Buster.JS Beta 3</h1>

<h2>Breaking changes</h2>

<p>This is a list of breaking changes in this release. Since we haven't reached 1.0 stable yet, we're changing APIs without making them backwards compatible.</p>

<h3>Some expectations changed names</h3>

<p>We're renaming some of our expectations, the intent is basically to match the expectations in Jasmine since that's what people are used to, and since they have good well thought out names.</p>

<p>TODO: Add list of changes. Issue 91</p>
