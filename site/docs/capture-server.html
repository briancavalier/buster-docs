  <p>
    Loads resource sets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, ...) into browsers
    (captured slaves) via an HTTP API and/or a JavaScript API.
  </p>
  <p>
    Resource sets are loaded into the server as sessions. Sessions are queued, so
    that when the current session ends, the next session in the queue is
    immediately loaded into the captured slaves.
  </p>
  <p>
    Buster.JS creates one session for each test run.
  </p>
  <p>
    buster-capture-server is also completely reusable, and has no direct knowledge
    of running tests. One example
    is <a href="http://github.com/augustl/slidebuster">Slidebuster</a>, where a
    session is a presentation, and the generic messaging in buster-capture-server
    is used to synchronize current slide state across the captured browsers.

    <h2>Creating a server</h2>
    <h3 id="create"><code>var server = bCaptureServer.create()</code></h3>
    <p>Creates a new server instance.</p>
    <h3 id="attach"><code>server.attach(<a href="http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/http.html">httpServer</a>)</code></h3>
    <p>
      Attaches the buster-capture-server to a Node.js HTTP server.
    </p>
    <p>
      The procedure injects itself into the request event of the http server so
      that the <code>"request"</code> handlers only run for requests that
      buster-server doesn't handle. Other than that, buster-server leaves the HTTP
      server untouched.

    <h2>Capturing slaves</h2>
    <p>
      A captured slave is (typically) a browser that is "captured" by loading an
      HTML page with a communication channel (event emitter) between the
      buster-capture-server and the browser. When the browser receives the event
      for loading a session, a frame gets its <code>src</code> attribute set to
      the URL that corresponds to the root HTML page for that session.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Buster.JS testing, the root document contains the specified testbed or
      the default plain testbed, and <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags for all the
      loadable scripts from the config file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Framesets are used so that the session root HTML page spans the full
      viewport of the captured slave (browser).
    </p>
    <h3 id="oncapture"><code>server.oncapture = function(req, res, <a href="#captured-slave">slave</a>){}</code></h3>
    <p>
      This property is required.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capturing a slave is always done via a GET request to
      the <a href="#capture-path">capturePath</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are required to define the behaviour of the HTTP request.
    </p>
    <pre><code>server.oncapture = function (req, res, <a href="#captured-slave">slave</a>) {
    res.writeHead(302, {"Location": slave.<a href="#captured-slave-url">url</a>});
    res.end();
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      It's important that you <code>end()</code> the request. If you don't, it'll
      hang indefinitely and the browser will eventually time out.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are free to do whatever you want here. You don't have to redirect
      to <code>slave.url</code>. You can for example redirect to a page that lets
      you configure additional options for the captured browser, and then redirect
      to the <code>slave.url</code> when you're done.
    </p>
    <h3 id="capture-path"><code>server.capturePath = "/capture"</code></h3>
    <p>
      The default value of this property is <code>"/capture"</code>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="capture-header"><code>server.header(height, resourceSet)</code></h3>
    <p>
      Adds a header to captured browsers. It is positioned above the main session
      frame, and is given the height specified. The document in the frame will be
      the root resource in the resource set. It will stay in place when you change
      session, and even when there's no session in progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      TODO: Write about the environment. We probably want messaging here, for
      example.

    <h2>Sessions</h2>
    <p>
      A session is the unit of work in a buster-capture-server.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a session is created, it is added to the bottom of the session
      queue. As soon as there are no other sessions above it in the queue, it is
      loaded into the captured slaves. When there are no other sessions in the
      queue, the session loads immediately upon creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loading a session into a captured slave basically means setting
      the <code>src</code> attribute of the session frame in the captured slave to
      the path to the root HTML document of the session's resource set.
    </p>
    <h3 id="create-session"><code>var sess = server.createSession(<a href="#session-payload">sessionPayload</a>)</code></h3>
    <p>
      Creates a new session.
    </p>
    <h3 id="session-payload">Session payload</h3>
    <p>
      The session payload is an object where the following properties are used:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>resourceSet</code>: A resource set instance. The root HTML page is the
      resource with the path <code>"/"</code>. It is assumed to be a HTML
      document. Everything in <code>load</code> of the resource set is added as
      script tags to the root HTML page. All other resources are made available to
      the session. Relative paths should be used since resources are not served on
      root and the context path isn't available to the session.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>joinable</code>: Defaults to <code>true</code>. A joinable session
      will be loaded in slaves that are captured while the session is active. In
      Buster.JS it's set to false for test run sessions.
    </p>
    <h3 id="create-session-http">POST /sessions</h3>
    <p>
      Creates a new session with HTTP.
    </p>
    <h4>Request body</h4>
    <p>
      A JSON encoded <a href="#session-payload">sessionPayload</a>. Instead of a
      resource set instance, a resource set object payload is instead used. TODO:
      Link to the docs for resource set object payloads.
    </p>
    <h4>Response body</h4>
    <p>
      A JSON encoded object with relevant information about the newly created
      session.
    </p>
    <pre><code>{
    "id": <a href="#session-id">session-id</a>,
    "contextPath": <a href="#session-context-path">session-context-path</a>

    </h3>
    <p>
      Stops the session with the given context path.
    </p>
    <h3 id="session-id"><code>sess.id</code></h3>
    <p>
      The ID of the session. TODO: Write about how this ID is useful for faye
      messaging.
    </p>
    <h3 id="session-context-path"><code>sess.contextPath</code></h3>
    <p>
      Used to reference the session by URL, such as when killing the session.
    </p>
    <h3 id="session-resource-set-path"><code>sess.resourceSetPath</code></h3>
    <p>
      The path to the root resource of the sessions resource set.
    </p>
    <h3 id="session-bayeux-path"><code>sess.bayeuxClientPath</code></h3>
    <p>
      The URL to use for creating Faye/bayeux clients. This property is also
      available on the server itself if you have programmatic access to it. The
      URL is the same for all sessions.
    </p>
    <h3 id="session-publish"><code>sess.publish(url, message)</code></h3>
    <p>
      Publishes a message on the session. Will be published to all captured slaves
      with the session loaded.
    </p>
    <h3 id="session-subscribe"><code>sess.subscribe(url, handler)</code></h3>
    <p>
      Subscribes on messages sent to the session. Will receive messages from all
      captured slaves with the session loaded, as well as the session object self.
